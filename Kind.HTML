	<FONT id='font'>Being kind attracts people to get close to you. People will like you and you can try and make friends with them. They will be comfortable but do not do it too much. It will seem awkward when you guys meet. Being kind is important to the middleschool students in KAS as they care about the kindness for 7 out of 10.</FONT>
