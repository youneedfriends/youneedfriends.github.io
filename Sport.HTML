	<FONT id='font'>Participating in sports is a good way to make more friends. I benefits you by giving you a chance to meet new people. It is also easier to make friends if you are good at a certain sport. Playing sports is very important to the middleschool students in KAS as they care about playing sports for 8 out of 10.</FONT>
