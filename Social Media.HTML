	<FONT id='font'>Social media is a special way to make friends. Though you are technically not socializing face to face, it is still a good way to meet and talk to more people. But be sure to not rely on it too much, since you would end up with even less friends. Social Media is important to the middleschool students in KAS as they care about social media for 7 out of 10.</FONT>
